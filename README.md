# Sustainability & Green-AI Usage Tracker

## 🚀 Project Objective
This project aims to develop a tool that trains standard machine learning models while simultaneously tracking their computational and environmental footprint using CodeCarbon. The entire workflow is managed using MLOps principles (MLflow, GitHub Actions) and deployed as an interactive web application with Streamlit.

## ✨ Core Features
- Train ML models on a given dataset.
- Track and log CO2 emissions, energy consumption, and training duration for each model run.
- Use MLflow to compare experiments based on both performance metrics (e.g., accuracy) and sustainability metrics (e.g., CO2eq).
- Provide a Streamlit dashboard to visualize and compare the results.

## 💡 Motivation

As AI models grow in complexity, their computational and energy demands skyrocket. This project aims to bring awareness to the environmental impact of ML by providing a simple, integrated dashboard to monitor the CO₂ emissions and energy usage alongside traditional performance metrics like accuracy.
